 *
 * \section description Description
 *
 * nXML is a C library for parsing, writing and creating XML 1.0 and 1.1 files
 * or streams. It supports utf-8, utf-16be and utf-16le, ucs-4 (1234, 4321,
 * 2143, 2312).
 *
 * This library is tested on Linux, Windows, *BSD, Solaris, Minix 3.
 *
 * Why another XML library? Because it is fast, easy-to-use and -important- it 
 * is my personal work about the second layer of the Semantic Web. Other my
 * softwares are based on this library. Annotea
 * (http://www.autistici.org/bakunin/annotea/), Morla
 * (http://www.autistici.org/bakunin/morla/) and libmrss
 * (http://www.autistici.org/bakunin/libmrss/).
 *
 * Why Nxml ? N is from
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples">Naples</a> a beautiful italian
 * city. I was there when I started to write this code. Who doesn't know 
 * Naples, maybe he should spend some day in that city because it is full of
 * history, culture and wonderful people.
